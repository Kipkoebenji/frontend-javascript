# Frontend Roadmap

## Core Web Foundations

These never get outdated — everything else builds on them.

### HTML

- Semantic HTML
- Forms & validation
- Accessibility roles
- Metadata (SEO, social preview, structured data)

### CSS

- Responsive design
- Flexbox + Grid
- Custom properties (CSS variables)
- Animations & transitions
- Media queries (screen, motion, color-scheme)
- Modern units: rem, vh, min(), clamp()

### JavaScript

- Scope, closures, hoisting
- `this` + prototypes
- Modules (import/export)
- Promises, async/await
- Classes & OOP patterns
- Functional programming basics
- Fetch & Web APIs (localStorage, workers)
- Event loop & microtask queue (SUPER IMPORTANT)
- Error handling

## 2. React + Next.js (The Meta Skill)

React isn't dead and Next.js became the default for production.

### React core concepts

- Components, props, state
- Hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo, useCallback)
- Context
- Controlled vs uncontrolled inputs
- Reconciliation & rendering

### Next.js 2025–2026 stuff

- App router (modern)
- Server components vs client components
- Route handlers (API endpoints)
- Streaming & Suspense boundaries
- Data fetching (fetch(), caching, revalidation)
- Static vs Dynamic vs ISR
- Middleware
- Edge vs Server Functions
- Authentication patterns

## 3. TypeScript (Non-negotiable)

This became mandatory in serious frontend teams.

### Concepts:

- Types vs Interfaces
- Utility types
- Generics
- Narrowing
- Type inference
- Zod or Valibot for validation
- TS + React patterns

## 4. Styling & Design Systems

Frontend devs need taste + structure now.

### Tools:

- Tailwind CSS (dominates 2026)
- CSS Modules
- Radix UI / Shadcn UI
- Framer Motion (micro interactions)
- Tokens (for colors, spacing, etc.)

### Design concepts:

- Design tokens
- Component-driven UI
- Spacing scale
- Layout systems
- Dark mode / prefers-color-scheme
- Motion & delight (subtle animations)

## 5. State & Data

State management evolved → simpler & server-first.

### Important:

- Server state vs Client state (VERY IMPORTANT)
- Query caching (TanStack Query / Next cache)
- Zustand/Jotai/Recoil (small)
- Form libraries (React Hook Form)

### Patterns:

- Optimistic updates
- Prefetching
- Pagination & infinite scroll
- Streaming UIs with Suspense

## 6. Backend Touch for Frontend

To be employable you must understand:

- REST vs GraphQL
- Authentication & sessions
- Cookies vs tokens
- CORS
- Rate limits
- Server actions (new)
- WebSockets (real-time)
- Databases as APIs (Supabase, Convex, Appwrite)

Not deep backend, just enough to talk to it well.

## 7. Performance & Deployment

Production skills separate juniors from real frontend devs.

### Performance:

- Lighthouse basics
- Bundle analysis
- Lazy loading
- Code splitting
- Image optimization
- Cache headers
- Edge rendering

### Deployment:

- Vercel / Netlify
- Docker basics (optional)
- CI/CD pipelines
- Feature flags

### Monitoring:

- Sentry (errors)
- LogRocket (sessions)
- Tracing

## 8. AI & New Interfaces (2026+ Skillset)

Modern apps add AI features:

- AI chat interfaces
- AI actions
- AI input assistance (autocomplete, summarization)
- Embeddings for search
- Voice + multimodal interactions

Frontend's job is UX around AI, not building models.

## 9. Collaboration & Product Skills

Teams now expect:

- Git + branching
- Code review etiquette
- Component documentation
- Figma collaboration
- Understanding UX thinking
- Writing tech specs
- Estimation & delivery

Big advantage if learned early.

## 10. Optional but Valuable Differentiators

Pick 1 or 2:

### Web Animations / Framer

For delightful products

### WebGL / Three.js

For 3D experiences

### Mobile Frontend

React Native / Expo

### Desktop

Electron / Tauri

### WebAssembly

Growing, especially rust+UI
